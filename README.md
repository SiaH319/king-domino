# Kingdomino

Check out our [wiki page](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE223-Winter2020/ecse223-group-project-04/wiki)!

## Project Overview
Create the Kingdomino application for the well-known board game Kingdomino.

Players are identified by their color (green, blue, yellow, pink).
There are six types of terrains, namely, wheat field (W: yellow), lake (L, blue),
forest (F: dark green), grass (G: light green), mountain (M: black), swamp (S: light brown).

Dominos are uniquely identified by their number (between 1 and 48) and their actual content
(i.e. type of terrain on each tile and the number of crowns).
The figure on the right presents all the dominos in an increasing order (i.e. top-left is 1, bottom-right is 48).
For test files, these dominos will be represented textually.
For example, 19:F+W(1) denotes domino #19 containing a wheat field with one crown and a
forest without a crown (thus the default value of crowns is 0 if not indicated otherwise).

## Deliverable 1

Deliverables for Iteration 1 – Domain Model, Constraints, GUI Mockup [wiki](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE223-Winter2020/ecse223-group-project-04/wiki/Iteration-1)

- Use Umple to define the domain model showing all concepts and relationships of the
Kingdomino game including all features to be developed to play the game.

- Capture the 10 most important (interesting) constraints of the domain which are not covered by
your domain model in a controlled natural language.

- For each feature of the game, you will need to create a mockup of the user interface and
document it in the wiki of your Github repository.

- Generate code from the domain model and commit the code to your group’s repository in the
GitHub organization of the course (https://github.com/McGill-ECSE223-Winter2020/).

The domain model of our Kingdomino application can be found [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE223-Winter2020/ecse223-group-project-04/wiki/Domain-Model)
